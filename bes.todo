feb 22
- make sure new bes_test framework finds FOO.PY files (upper case0
- move all the file path stuff from file_util to file_path

feb 23
- add git.root test

feb 26
- fix bes_test.py --ignore so that patterns are automatically created 'foo' => '*foo*' i guess check whether pattern is patterns first
- write egg.py unit tests

mar 2
- text_line_parser append and prepend are very dumbly named

mar 6 - figure out why such droppings collect /tmp/test_archive_tar-tmp-5h87Js.tar

mar 8
- when no files are given on command line shit happnes (especially wiht -g flag)

mar 14
- enum defaults seem to be messed (requirement_hardness)

archive:
create for archive_unix_tar not working for all formats plus unit tests

rewrite _handle_extract_strip_common_ancestor to be more effecient when the tar
contents match the expectations of the interface
use xz command line tool if available for archive_xz deps
probe to figure out what formats command line tar supports
add validation that include and exclude lists dont clash
add validation that include and exclude lists dont clash

move test_extract_all from test_archive_dmg to common
archiver unit tests

text table issue swith utf8

2018-10-16
- check.check_string_seq() returns true for strings need to fix this

2018-10-21
- move string_list from bes.text to bes.common

theres a confusing comlfict between items in make_temp_dir and temp_content.  clarify it
temp_content parsing should deal with the fact DIR requires and empty "" content string

audit os_env to make sure there is no os.environ usage and put anything that uses environ in a system_os_env kind of thing

consider the locations of os_env env_var might be bes.env

fix bes_env_path_append and friends to check the first argument to be a good shell var name

tree text parser - tests for get_text()

tar_util.copy_tree() has no error checking and causes errors to be spewed to stdout instead
of rasing a python exception
see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9393425/python-how-to-execute-shell-commands-with-pipe

2018-10-29

- s/Waiter/waiter/
- mv lib/bes/env to a unix only place
- checks for compat.IS_PYTHON3 in http unit tests.

archiver.format_name() returns tar for tgz
cleanup git.archive

unit tests for all the git.repo_run_scripts() options  (i tested them manually)
unit tests for all the git.clone() options (i tested them manually)

New
- looks like execute.execute() does honor raise_error when the program doesnt exist
- the url util methods that choose python or requests need to raise the same exception
  it varies between RuntimeError and HTTPErro depending which one is chosen.  ths
  unit tests catch both
